# Your friend who still listens to EDM
At a party and they're blasting hardcore house music 

Them: "Bro...it's called new wave jazz ??fusion??"

Me: "I listened to edm in college man"

T: "yeah but this is different"

T: "bro griz is coming to town in august you gotta come. We got a sheet of acid and ??ketamine??"

T: Keep pushing/explaining the edm/wook lifestyle (drugs at concerts, edm subgenres, festivals)

Me: "yeah man...I was into edm for years" 

??possibly have edm playing at a somber/not appropriate situation (funeral, wedding)
