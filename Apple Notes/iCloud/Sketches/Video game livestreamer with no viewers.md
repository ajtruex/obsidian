# Video game livestreamer with no viewers

Since covid began a lot of people have been live streaming on twitch while they game

Dude with the whole streamer setup (overlay, widgets, donations, branding, etc) and talking out loud but with no one in the stream

Eventually gets one viewer only to realize it is his mom who feels bad

"How do you even know what twitch is?" "Get outta here"
