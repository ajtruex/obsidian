# When the bass comes in super weak
A song that everybody knows has a heavy baseline starts playing from a small Bluetooth speaker

Everyone is feeling it. They're anticipating the bass drop but when it drops the speaker shits the bed and you can barely hear it at all

Everyone looses their shit and proceeds to try and find a better source to play music

Sketch escalates:

First a different speaker. Second the TV. Then someone busts out a tapco. Next thing it is a full speaker stack and it's blasting. 

Up until the last speaker everyone is making a sour face (complaining that it's not bassy enough) and then everyone busts out and starts dancing/rapping
