There's a throughline in the hip hop music that I have loved over the years

I always knew that I didn't make much of lyrics in all music. To me it is more of an instrument that fits into the melody of a song. There are songs I love and have listened to habitually for years that I do not know the lyrics to. The argument in hip hop when I was growing up was always about who was the best lyricist, but that never held much value to me. 

In my late teens/early 20s I realized that what really attracted me to a song was the production. In the age old Tupac vs. Biggie debate it was easy for me to choose Big because the production level on almost all of his songs was top notch. Diddy and the team at bad boy created such infectious sounding beats (shit that makes you do the stank face) that drew anyone within earshot in. I first heard Big Poppa in the movie Hardball when I was 8 years old and became obsessed. I had my moms boyfriend burn me a CD with 8 tracks, all Big Poppa (clean version). I had no clue what he was rapping about but I did not care. 

Early pac suffered from some pretty subpar production but he was such a poetic and powerful lyricist that most people do not even bat an eye. Most of his early work did not connect with me but his songs with the elite west coast producers (Dre) were on the same level as Biggie.

I came to these realizations far after the fact. I recognized this most because of Kanye. As most know, Ye produced songs for many hip hop artists for years before he ever rapped on a track. Many accredit Jay-Z's resurgence to Kanye's production. He is all over The Blueprint trilogy. Then when Kanye started rapping over his own beats and the rest is history as they say. Superstar. I have always loved that era of Jay and despite his recent turmoil I am a borderline Kanye stan. If he is on the 1s and 2s for any artist there is a good chance the song will pique my interest.

Then I realized DJ Dahi produced all my favorite songs unbeknownst to me. Proving that it truly is the production that hooks me
