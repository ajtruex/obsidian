Application for Consultant

**Have you ever been convicted of a criminal offense that has not been expunged, restricted, or sealed by a judge? Convicted means you were declared guilty by a judge or you pleaded guilty in court. A conviction may have even taken place if you did not pay a fine or spend time in jail or in prison. A conviction could have been for either a misdemeanor or a felony. For IU purposes, driving while under the influence, driving on a suspended license, reckless driving, leaving the scene of an accident, and vehicular homicide are not minor traffic violations and must be declared (whether the result is a ticket or a more severe pen- alty). Minor traffic violations that result in tickets do not need to be declared. A criminal history inves- tigation is done on each new employee, and employment with the University is conditional, subject to the findings of a criminal history investigation. Answering yes to this question does not automatically disqualify you for employment; however, information obtained from the investigation will be used in the employment review process.**

## Agreement Acknowledgement
I certify that all information provided in all my application material is true. I understand that any false statement made herein is sufficient reason for rejection of this application or termination of subsequent employment regardless of date of discovery. I authorize the university to investigate all statements made in my application material for employment. I authorize such educational institutions and employers and others (and their agents or employees) to respond to questions concerning information given in this application material and I further release from liability such former employers, institutions or persons providing such information to the university.

I understand that the direct deposit of my paycheck to my personal checking or savings account is a condition of employment.
I have carefully read and understand this statement and, by creating this application, note such.
