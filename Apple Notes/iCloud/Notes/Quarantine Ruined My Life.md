# Quarantine Ruined My Life

## Quarantine Ruined My Life

A story about my life fell apart during quarantine

No job

Drinking a lot

Pothead

Made money in crypto (blew) it

Depression hopelessness 

Live with my mom

Antidepressants (other drugs)

Hating existing

Friends and mom were my only lifeline

Now I get a good job
