# Whit if in some bizarre turn of events every single horse is affected by a deadly disease, so unfortunately, they go extinct. Would you take me into consideration to be your surrogate horse? I would live outside, stay on all four legs at all times, and try to bring you some inkling of comfort since your real horses are gone. Why would I put myself through this you ask? Well because the days you decide you wanna take a few laps around the field I'll be right there under you. Saddle or not I'll be the luckiest man horse on earth. 

Unrelated, for as long as I have a face, you, Whitney Cummings will always have a place to sit.
