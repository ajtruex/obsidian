The popular thing right now is to "talk about mental health" and "kick the stigma" but try telling your friends that you think about killing yourself daily. Sometimes as the first and last thought of a day. If you wanna see the stigma break back out in full force then say you don't want to live anymore. The reaction is actually a positive one. Your friends care about you and even mentioning suicide hoists every red flag. On the other hand if your friends are pestering you about not going out or missing an event it is because they don't know how much of a struggle it is to even be alive everyday. If you were to say "I can barely make it through the day let alone get showered and dressed to go interact socially" their reaction would quickly turn into worry. I don't want people to worry. I'm not going to kill myself but it is true that I don't want to be alive. I don't want my closest friends walking on eggshells and thinking before they say something around me. That's why the stigma will never go away. That's why talking about mental health is great in theory but not in practice. 

Little do they know, they're also the reason why actually committing suicide is not a tangible option.
