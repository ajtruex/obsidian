I am also a budding web developer in college (IUPUI actually, not too far from West Lafayette) and I gotta say that what you've done with your Instagram is spectacular. 35,000 followers in under a year seems unfathomable to me. I'm just now feeling comfortable enough to start posting and talking about my dev experience. My question is what were the things you did to get such rapid growth on a social media platform and what advice would you give to someone essentially in your shoes who is starting to finally feel comfortable enough with the subject matter to be able to post and talk about it in the public forum with enough understanding that it might warrant a few people to look at it, or...ya know **35,000**. Seriously,* *that* *is an achievement in its own right.
