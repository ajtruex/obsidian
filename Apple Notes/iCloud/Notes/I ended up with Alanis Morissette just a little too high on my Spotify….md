# I ended up with Alanis Morissette just a little too high on my Spotifyâ€¦

I ended up with Alanis Morissette just a little too high on my Spotify Wrapped this year, and I think it could be one of two things. 

~~I finally stopped caring about unabashedly blaring her music around friends/alone or that maybe she's convinced me that I could go down in a THEATRE~~

Every dude that ever dated Alanis Morissette after You Oughta Know dropped almost certainly tried to get them tix to the THeatre as much as he could

"What do you wanna do tonight babe?"

"I thought we could go see a movie ya know at the theater"

"....this'll be the 7th week in a row we've gone there. Just ask me to go down on you if that's what you really want"

"It really is. I didn't even lookup showtimes or anything." 

(Maybe a dispute about like "you did it to Dave couiller am I not special enough to write a song about")

"We've been to the movies for almost 2 straight months. Before that you claimed you loved the opera so we had to attend every single performance for 6 months just for blowjobs. I mean your sack has gotta just be like a deflated elderly water balloon at this point."

Later you see the boyfriend playing you oughta know while trying to suck his own dick
