"Live in the future, then build what's missing" –– "or live in the future and build what seems interesting.."

"Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution." - Trevor Blackwell

Don’t "think up" ideas but "notice" gaps and anomalies 

A good way to trick yourself into noticing ideas is to work on projects that seem like they'd be cool. If you do that, you'll naturally tend to build things that are missing.

"Would you use this thing yourself, if you hadn't written it?"

“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.” — Steve Jobs, Stanford Commencement Speech 2005

“Everything in the world was created by people no smarter than you” - Steve Jobs

Perpetual motion

1. They’re something the founders themselves want (I wanted to automate web forms)
2. That they themselves can build (I had the dev skills and experience)
3. And that few others realize are worth doing (two competitors emerged right after my release, but the market was otherwise untapped).
