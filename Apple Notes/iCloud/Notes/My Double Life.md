# My Double Life
One as a budding web developer and informatics student at IUPUI. Another as a Xanax addicted, marijuana reliant 25 yo lazy piece of shit who can't event find the motivation to clean up his room or appearance. The force behind these two drastically different personalities inhabiting the same body is Adderall.
