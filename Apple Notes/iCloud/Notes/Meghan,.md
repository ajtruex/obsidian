# Meghan,

Meghan,

I am not your toy. I am not something that you can play with when you feel like and then put away when you are not interested. I remember myself saying that you were going to break up with me and then realize in a few weeks or months that you wanted me back, but I was not gonna be there this time. I said these exact words to you, and look what is happening. 

I fought for this for so long, and was working on changing the aspects of myself that hurt you when you ended things. What I've realized is that those aspects of me only exist when I am around you. Remember when we met, how different I was? Sure I was an asshole then and still am, but I was never negative, I was never sad, I was hardly angry, I didn't have worries, I had never experienced anxiety in my life. I was fun loving and easygoing, my only goal was to have the best time possible. You told me that I was the most interesting person that you had ever met and I took so much pride in that, but I don't feel like that person anymore. What I have transformed into throughout this relationship is nothing like that person. I told you in the beginning that I only wanted to be together if it made us both happy, an ideal we abandoned long ago. 

I've been scarred. We hurt each other in ways that I used to have real nightmares about. Nightmares that I'd wake up from and text you immediately so I could be reassured that something like that would never happen. You were somehow able to get over these nightmarish memories and I applaud that, but I still to this day think about it all the time. 

I think that when we did that to each other is when a lot changed for me personally. You were completely and utterly mine before that. You thought that was possessive at times for me to think, but to me it was just that I was the only person that you thought was worth sharing yourself with. I would give back everything I did with anyone if I knew that I was going to meet you so that we could have shared that experience. That was special to me, and I'll never get that back.

I am fairly certain that this was the main contribution to why I started treating you so poorly. Subconsciously I thought differently of you whether I liked it or not. You always thought I was embarrassed to post with you or about you on social media, but honestly I was just ashamed that we were that couple. That couple that fights and breaks up all the time, that couple who lied to each other, that couple that fucked other people, that couple we said we would never turn into.

Since we've been broken up this time I've realized all of this. This time is different for me. I decided I was not gonna chase you like the pathetic fuck I had become. I was not gonna listen to your lies, get strung along, or be hurt anymore. This time I decided that I am done. 

Since I decided that I've found myself becoming happier by the day. When I wake up I don't wanna lay in bed for a few more hours to escape the day anymore. I'm excited about whatever the day holds even if it's just going to class or sitting on the couch. People who I hardly know are noticing that I'm smiling and being more friendly. I am seeing myself become the person I was when I first met you, and I love this person. I've missed this person. It's not being single either like you may be thinking. It has nothing to do with any other person except for myself. I am me again.

At this point in life and in a relationship marriage is a realistic thought. And Ive thought long and hard about you and I getting married. The conclusion I came to was that I would never survive. I could never be married to someone who is capable of lying to me for long periods of time, not knowing if I even know the full truth about some things. I could never be married to someone who quits every single time we struggle, and then copes with it by "distracting" themselves with other guys and self-destructive behavior. I could never be married to someone that I would have to wake up to everyday and think about how much it hurts just to look at you and know that you won't ever be the girl I fell in love with again. 

That girl is gone. You were my everything. You were the love of my life. You had my whole heart. I fought for what I thought I wanted for so long, and all I got out of it was scars and pain. I know now that girl and the way I felt about her is gone, both in reality and in my perception. The reason this has been so easy for me is because I realize now that you are not my girl anymore. Not because we aren't together, but because she has been gone for awhile now. 

I'll always have a special place in my heart for that girl. I'll always care about how you are doing and would still give my life for you, but I cannot be with you anymore. I refuse to let myself hurt any longer and owe it to myself to be who I truly am again. Whether it was you, or me, or a combination of both of us it has come to the point where it needs to end for me. 

I love you,
Andrew
