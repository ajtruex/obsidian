# Meghan,

Meghan,

I am not your toy. I am not something that you can play with when you feel like and then put away when you are not interested. I remember myself saying that you were going to break up with me and then realize in a few weeks or months that you wanted me back, but I was not gonna be there this time. I said these exact words to you and look what is happening. 

I fought for this for so long, and was working on changing the aspects of myself that hurt you when you ended things. What I've realized is that those aspects of me only exist when I am around you. Remember when we met, how different I was? Sure I was an asshole then and still am, but I was never negative, I was never sad, I was hardly angry, I didn't have worries, I had never experienced anxiety in my life. I was fun loving and easygoing, my only goal was to have the best time possible. I told you that I only wanted to be together if it made us both happy. You told me that I was the most interesting person that you had ever met and I took so much pride in that. What I've transformed into throughout this relationship is nothing like that person I was.

I've been scarred. We hurt each other in ways that I used to have real nightmares about. Nightmares that I'd wake up from and text you immediately so I could be reassured that something like that would never happen. You were somehow able to get over it and I applaud that, but I still to this day think about it everyday.

I think that is when a lot changed for me personally. You were completely and utterly mine. You thought that was possessive at times for me to think, but to me it was just that I was the only person that you thought was worth sharing yourself with. I would give back everything I did with anyone if I knew that I was going to meet you so that we could have shared it. That was special to me, and I'll never get that back.

I am fairly certain that this was the main contribution to why I started treating you so poorly. Subconsciously I thought differently of you whether I liked it or not. You always thought I was embarrassed to post with you or about you on social media, but honestly I was just ashamed that we were that couple. That couple that breaks up all the time, that couple who lied to each other, that couple that fucked other people, that couple we said we would never turn into. 

Since we've been broken up I've realized all of this. I've found myself becoming happier. When I wake up I don't wanna lay in bed for a few more hours to escape the day anymore. I'm excited about whatever the day holds even if it's just going to class or sitting on the couch. People who I hardly know are noticing that I'm smiling and being more friendly.
