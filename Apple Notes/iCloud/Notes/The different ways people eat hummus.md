# The different ways people eat hummus
What the method in which you eat hummus says about you
(What/how the way you eat hummus says about you)
* Instant spreader (spreads whole center immediately)
	* Chaotic individual, no organization, wild, immediate gratification
* Saver (eats most of the outside before touching center)
	* Thoughtful, very organized, delayed gratification
* Equal center/edge ratio (uses moderate chunk of center equal to the amount of edge on one chip)
	* Calculated risk taker, never bites off more than they can chew, perfect balance
* Eats around the center (only eats the hummus not the center toppings)
	* Picky eater, not adventurous, square, probably never even tried sushi
