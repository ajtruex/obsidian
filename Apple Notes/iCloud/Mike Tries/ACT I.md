ACT I
EXT. TRAVELING TO HOTEL - DAY
Riding in the back of a taxi MIKE TRIES is muttering to himself.
MIKE
(Inner Monologue)
Fuck this fucking cult. I've been doing this shit for twenty six fucking years. So many fucking Tomatoes planted and onions planted and goat dicks sucked. I've had to suck innumerous goat dicks in the last twenty six fucking years all them fucking and go dicks. I think it's time for me to leave. This is good for me. I'm going to set off on a new adventure.
INT. FRONT DESK OF THE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
Mike walks over to the front desk and is greeted by an unusually tall, 88 year old Asian woman.
MS. RHONDA
Welcome to The Larry Hotel. How can I help you?
MIKE
I'll take the cheapest room you got.
MS. RHONDA
Lucky for you I got a twin bed in the basement that's cheaper than these used needles
Motions to a basket full of syringes sitting beside the desk
MIKE
(begrudgingly)
I'll take it
MS. RHONDA
Great! First night is on the house if you clean up the flipflop my dog just shit out down there.
INT. FRONT DESK OF THE HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
MIKE
Ummm...
MS. RHONDA
(Before Mike has a chance to answer)
Someone will bring your bags down shortly.
INT. SHITTY HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Mike is fucking around with the TV in amazement when he hears a knock on the door
MIKE
Ummm...hello?
DRUG GURU
What the fuck’s up you piece of shit?
MIKE
Excuse me?
DRUG GURU
I asked if you needed help picking up that piece of shit?
MIKE
Oh yeah I got it. Are you the one who was bringing my bags?
DRUG GURU
What the fuck is with you people and your fucking bags? *whinny voice* oh I need my fucking bag so I can jerk off like a 12 year old with a crush on his step mother.
MIKE
Hey man, I just want my bags I'm not trying to jerk off on any 12 year olds or what ever you're saying
DRUG GURU
Why not? It looks like you could use it.
MIKE
Bruh... you don't even know. I don't think I need to jerk off a 12 year old but I could use something....for the last 26 years I haven't done anything. It's always been work here, plant this, suck that...and so on.
DRUG GURU
What do you mean suck that?
MIKE
I don't want to talk about it...
DRUG GURU
You know what? I think I go that perfect thing. You need to try something new...how bout a fat stoogerson.
MIKE
stoogerson?
DRUG GURU
a doobster, a dutchie, funky chron stick, the time travelers wand, Zeus' shaft, psychedelic toothpick, mamas ol' medicine, the devils green baton, sweet leaf tea, Smoochy Poochie slab, Rock ‘n Roll Tobacco,the god damn Sinner’s Spinach, Grim Reefer, the singing Dank Sinatra, you know the Bro-coli.
MIKE
What the fuck are you talking about?
DRUG GURU
Weed, man! Marijuana.
MIKE
Never heard of it
DRUG GURU
(beside himself with confusion)
HOW THE FUCK HAVE YOU GONE 26 YEARS ON THIS EARTH AND NEVER HEARD OF THE STICK ICKY GREEN SHIT?!?!
MIKE
(cofnused again)
You lost me again?
DRUG GURU
WEED, MAN! Keep up
MIKE
Ok, I think I'm getting it. All these names and terms are for something you call weed??
DRUG GURU
Finally you're up to speed. Have you really not heard of marijuana??
MIKE
I gotta be honest with you, man. I've been trapped in a cult since I was born...I don't know much of anything outside of sucking...*cough* I mean plowing fields and milking cows
DRUG GURU
Seems like you got something about sucking in your past man
MIKE
It's not about the goat dicks man. My cult was sequestered from the world. I am 26 years old with the life experience of a damn toddler.
DRUG GURU
Fo' reallll???
MIKE
Yeah dude. I don't know why I'm telling this shit to the fucking bootleg bellhop but I need to let this shit out
DRUG GURU
Bellhop? Just because I bring people's bags to their rooms doesn't mean I am just a puss ass bellhop
MIKE
Then what the fuck are you and why are you in my room?
DRUG GURU
Relaxxx little man. I do all sorts of things for this joint. I saw you happened to rent the shittiest room in the whole Larry Hotel so I thought I'd uhhh...help you out a bit
MIKE
Just because I took the cheapest room doesn't mean I should have to tolerate your bullshit
DRUG GURU
Easeeee uppp little homie. I ain't offering bullshit. I may have a small business opportunity for you.
MIKE
Why the fuck would I need a hand out from you?
DRUG GURU
(looking around the shitty basement room)
Have you seen the place you just agreed to live in?
MIKE
(realizing the reality of his situation)
I guess you’re right...but I don’t know much about the modern world since, ya know. I’ve been in a fucking cult my whole life.
DRUG GURU
No worrrriesss my inexperienced compadre. That’s why you got me. They call me the Denzel Washington in Training Day of drugs
MIKE
...didn’t Denzel get murdered at the end of that movie?
DRUG GURU
(looking at Mike suspiciously/side-eyed)
As long as you ain’t about to pull some Ethan Hawke snitching bullshit on me then the metaphor still works
MIKE
But you said drugs?? Is that your business? Selling drugs
DRUG GURU
Not exactly young gun. You’ve got a lot to learn.
MIKE
Umm...I don’t think I should get involved in drugs. I mean, I have never even done a drug in my entire life.
