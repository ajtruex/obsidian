# The year is 2009. You're a mid-level manager at a decent sized companyâ€¦

The year is 2009. You're a mid-level manager at a decent sized company who just had to layoff a large portion of their employees due to the financial crisis that occurred a year prior. Your job is safe though. The higher ups said you are indispensable to the company. Feeling proud and relieved you decide that it's finally about time to trade in that old Toyota Camry for something new but modest. You are loyal to the Toyota brand but you also plan on having children in the near future so you opt for the next model size bigger, a RAV4. As you're driving home from the dealership you're listening to the radio when a single off JAY-Z's upcoming album The Blueprint 3 comes on. You haven't heard the song before but you already know it's a hit. The RAV4 radio display reads "Run This Town", a feature your old car didn't have. After two top notch verses from HOV and Rihanna belting the choruses, you don't expect anyone else to be on the song. That's when Kanye comes in and you start vibing even harder. Riding in your brand new whip, confident the company you slave away for values your hard work, sitting pretty while a recession is going on. You're starting to believe the lyrics you're hearing. Maybe you do run this town? That's when you hear Kanye say "What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' RAV4?"
