The NBA but with called fouls
Burning jerseys for a player calling a foul

I think the nba would be a hell of a lot more entertaining if they called their own fouls. 

Growing up playing basketball and you called a foul on anything that didn't draw blood you were a bitch. 

It'd completely change the game for players and spectators too. There would be no more called fouls for years unless it was serious...but then...Game 7 on the line and Lebron drives down the lane and misses a layup after some contact from steph curry and just says " foul gimme my two shots"

People would fucking lose their minds. There would be rioting in the streets. People would be burning jerseys while saying "I ain't support no bitch who calls fouls on himself"
