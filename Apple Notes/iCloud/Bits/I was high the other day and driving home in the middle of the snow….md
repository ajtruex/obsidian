# I was high the other day and driving home in the middle of the snow…

I was high the other day and driving home in the middle of the snow storm and wasn't really paying much attention when suddenly I was like "Where the fuck am I?". I looked around and only saw barren fields so I pulled up my GPS app and punched in my home address and I was 45 minutes from my house. I only started about 20 minutes away...so that means I drove 20 minutes towards my house and then another 25 passed it before realizing something was up...strong weed I guess. So I start to follow the directions on my GPS and it takes me through a small town I don't believe I have ever been in before. Before too long I see a huge yard sign in the front lawn of a house that says "Addison for Sheriff." I think to myself "oh that’s nice they must be the family of the guy running for sheriff", then after a few more houses pass I see "Burkhardt for Sheriff". Hmm. Small town maybe that’s the Burkhardt residence. Weird coincidence. But as I continue down the main street of this tiny town I see Addison for Sheriff, Burkhardt for Sheriff, Addison, Burkhardt, Addison, Addison, Burkhardt, Burkhardt, Burkhardt. Well I'll be damned...if they don't have a hot sheriff race going down WhoGivesaFuck, Indiana.
