This old man said "you know they don't celebrate thanksgiving in Japan". This man is 88 years of age and is informing his 90 year old wife of this for the first time. She goes "oh they don't...I didn't know that"

I sat there like...no fucking shit you geriatric fuck. It's an American holiday. It'd be like japan celebrating the 4th of July, or remembering the Alamo. 

Or Americans celebrating a Japanese holiday like...idk...Pearl Harbor. 

I'm in my 20s and smarter than this woman who has lived for 9 decades.
