# Chugging a beer and throwing up is way worse than not chugging a beer and being called a pussy
I grew up with a weak stomach. I'm from the Midwest where everyone fucking drinks hard from the age of 13 on. My friends would chug vodka from handles, we called them half gallons, while we were playing beer pong. It fucking sucked to be my age and have a weak stomach. Our generation was the first to start video taping us all shotgun a beer and let me tell you I couldn't shotgun a beer for shit. I quickly found out that if I shotgunned a beer the foam would just form in my stomach and then I would throw it all up. It was fucking terrible. I would do it with my friends growing up but then once I got around girls I had to shut it the fuck down. I couldn't just be throwing up around girls I wanted to fuck. Absolutely no girl wants to fuck the dude who puked after shotgunning one beer. So I started just not shotgunning or chugging beer with my friends which is like sacrilegious in the bro community
