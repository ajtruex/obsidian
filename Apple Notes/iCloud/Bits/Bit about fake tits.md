Bit about fake tits

The thing about fake tits is that it took real doctors doing real research for their real job to try and find what felt closest to a titty

I can't help but to think that had to be the best job imaginable but also imagine going through all that schooling and accumulating all that debt only to be squeezing titties as a doctor

There had to be some disagreement

"I like em firm" "ah well I'm a floppy man myself"

When did the medical community collectively decide on silicone? Did they bring the implant around to all the plastic surgeons like Gollum from lord of the rings. 

We've found it. My preciousssssss
