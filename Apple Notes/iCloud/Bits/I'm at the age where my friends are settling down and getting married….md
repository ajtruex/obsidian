# I'm at the age where my friends are settling down and getting marriedâ€¦

I'm at the age where my friends are settling down and getting married and I've noticed quite the phenomena going on with the women not who have yet to go down the aisle yet.

(maybe put second paragraph after 12st sentence) So I don't believe I'm breaking any new ground here when I say....there's a great deal of women who hate watching sports the same way any man especially myself loathe the sound or sight of anyone within earshot speaking about those vapid whores they call the Kardashians. The woman who don't like sports also have no interest whatsoever in keeping it a secret. 

Yes..there are a few troopers who want you to think they're into whatever game you're watching because its only been three months and she has to make sure you're fully in love with this "super chill down to watch some sports whenever girl" before she flips the switch and reveals the true psycho within after you feel like she might different and special. 

But then something happens to those anti sports women between uhhh 27 and 30 lets say years old after they've seen a few of their friends get married and maybe even been a bridesmaid once or twice where they have this miraculous change of heart towards the whole concept of something they had previously made known to the world that they hated. They start asking questions that aren't even in the stratosphere of what is actually occurring in the sporting world.

It's like the middle of July and my girl says "So did the Yankees end up winning that world series last night?" 

I'm so flabbergasted by the question I'm not even upset she sounded so fucking dumb because I'm trying to figure out where the hell she even came up with the idea of a world series baseball game occurring during the offseason. So I ask her and she says to me, "well the other night when you were watching the world series I saw a guy hit a home run and the announcers said that it was all over and they won" ........that's when I realized I had the TV on ESPN2 late at night and they were playing back the Top 10 plays of 2018

(Add something about women becoming more interested in sports because they think that will cause us to say "oh you know what, NOW I think I'll propose because she's clearly fake interested in something I enjoy! You know what? No. Because as soon as that ring goes on it's right back to "youreee watching football agaiinnn"
